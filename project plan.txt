project plan

Great! Glad to hear you're back up and running. Let's proceed to the next steps:

Creating a Hero Image:
You can use a variety of tools to create a hero image. Here are a few options:

Photoshop: If you have graphic design skills, Photoshop is a powerful tool for creating custom images.
Canva: This is a user-friendly online design tool with a variety of templates, including ones for hero images.
Unsplash: This is a site where you can find high-quality, royalty-free photos. You could pick a beautiful image related to tile installation or luxury homes and use that as your hero image.
Make sure to optimize your image for the web. The image should ideally be under 500KB and not wider than 2000px for fast loading.

Developing the UX:
Here are some UX best practices to keep in mind:

Navigation: Make sure your navigation is intuitive and easy to use. Each page should be accessible within a few clicks from any other page.
Consistency: Keep your design elements and styling consistent throughout the website.
Whitespace: Give your content some room to breathe. Don't clutter your pages.
Contact Information: Make it easy for visitors to get in touch with you. Consider adding a contact form or making your email address prominent.
Content:
For a professional-looking website, the quality of your content is crucial. Here are a few pointers:

Value Proposition: Clearly state what makes Stonecraft Tile unique. What value do you bring to your customers? Why should they choose you over your competitors?
Services: List out all the services you offer. Provide detailed descriptions if possible.
About Us: Tell your story. People like to know who they are doing business with. Highlight your experience and expertise in the tile installation industry.
Portfolio: Showcase your best work. Include high-quality images and brief descriptions of each project.
Testimonials: If possible, include testimonials from satisfied customers. They build trust and credibility.
Remember, good web design and UX isn't just about how the site looks, but also about how it works. It's about making it easy for your visitors to find the information they're looking for and guiding them towards taking the action you want them to take (like reaching out for a quote).
